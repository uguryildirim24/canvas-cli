# Code review + fix — M1-c on branch lane/w1 (Codex, gpt-6-astra high)

You are the reviewer for this repo. A Cursor worker finished package M1-c
on branch `lane/w1` (worktree `/Users/rolfie/projects/canvas-cli`). Your job is to inspect it against
`docs/SPEC.md` and **fix what is wrong yourself**, then commit your fixes on
the same branch.

1. `cd /Users/rolfie/projects/canvas-cli`. Read the package brief `tasks/m1c-todo-assignments.md` and the SPEC sections it
   cites. First run `git merge main` (expect a trivial merge; resolve if needed and commit). Then read `git log main..HEAD --stat` and the full diff. This package is the round-3 interface owner: also check that the enum variants, dispatch stubs, and registry placeholders it added for M3-a (lane w2) and M2-b (lane w3) follow the brief, and that the `<assignment>` resolver and the `submission` dataset expose what M2-b needs (`tasks/m2b-submit-receipts.md` part 5).
2. Run the gates: `cargo fmt --all --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets
   --all-features -- -D warnings`, `cargo nextest run --all-features` (or
   `cargo test`), `cargo deny check`, `cargo +1.88 check --workspace
   --all-targets`. Use `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/Users/rolfie/projects/canvas-cli/.target/rev-m1c`.
3. Adversarial review: spec conformance (names, types, error variants, exit
   codes, schemas), correctness under the §16 cases the brief lists, security
   (§15: token handling, redaction, containment, no raw bodies on disk),
   MSRV 1.88, and dependency pins from Appendix A. Missing tests that the
   brief requires count as defects.
4. Fix every defect you find directly in the code. Keep the worker's
   structure unless it is wrong. Commit each logical fix separately with a
   message starting `review(M1-c):`. Do not push. Do not merge.
5. If something cannot be fixed without a spec change, do not guess: leave
   it and list it under "Needs a decision".

Output: `docs/reviews/code-M1-c.md` with: a 3-line verdict (MERGE /
MERGE-AFTER-DECISION / REJECT), the gate results, a table of defects found
(severity, file:line, what was wrong, what you changed, commit hash), and
"Needs a decision" items. Then reply exactly: `DONE docs/reviews/code-M1-c.md`
